			Hello! I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.
			Last summer, I interned at Mandli Communications writing software to stitch panoramas from roadway
			images, implementing many other features such as header and EXIF manipulation as well. I also work
			on side projects in my free time, which are variously incremental games, python games, and all learning
			experiences. I'm looking forward to what the future holds for me!
